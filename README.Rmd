# mlwdw26

Welcome to the package R historical2 - a new tool that wants to facilitate work with primary sources of history in R!

To obtain information about the past, it is essential to examine the evidence that has survived the testimonies of time and is still available to us today. These evidences can appear in many forms – as inscriptions on stones, as ancient ruins, or as texts that report on the time, sometimes even as contemporary witnesses. These evidences (or primary sources) are simply referred to as “sources” in historical science, and any “history books” written about these sources are called “(research) literature”. If historians want to answer a research question, they first have the task of collecting the sources relevant to their research and then evaluating them scientifically, taking into account the existing literature. Afterwards, they usually want to compile the sources into an organized text with the correct citations (a so-called source paper) in order to present their sources. However, the process of finding the sources, managing them, and ultimately creating the source paper can easily become very tedious and time-consuming. The author of this package is currently majoring in history and minoring in statistics and data science at the LMU of Munich and has faced this challenge several times himself.
