# mlwdw26 (MLW Data Wrangling 2026)

Welcome to the R package mlwdw26 – a new tool for organizing the data generated in the creation of the Medieval Latin Dictionary (MLW), which is being developed at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAdW) since 1939!

The primary goal of the package is to organize the articles of the MLW into a structured tabular format and to supplement and extend the often rather short citations provided as evidence in the articles using the source texts from which these citations were taken. This was intended, above all, to provide users with greater transparency regarding the data collected during the creation of the existing MLW articles and to enable the application of machine learning methods to this data in various research contexts.

# Installation

You can install and use the current version of mlwdw26 after you executed this in R:

```         
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ATSzimmat/mlwdw26")
library(mlwdw26)
```

# Functions

## *convert_doc*

### Description

-   This function converts .doc-files to .txt files using the LibreOffice program. The files used in the example are automatically loaded with the package and should be located in your project folder as a folder named "toy", after you installed the package.

-   This function takes into account the outdated line-break logic of doc-files.

-   Note: This function requires LibreOffice to be located in a folder named "Applications" and that you are currently using a Mac.

### Output

-   A new folder was created containing the converted files. The name of this folder is the same as the folder containing the .doc-files, with "\_txt" appended to the end.

### Assumptions

-   The folder containing the .doc files contains only .doc files (and no other documents or folders).

-   The user's computer (importantly a Mac) has the same LibreOffice program installed as the creator's computer, and it is located in the "Applications" folder.

### Usage

```         
convert_doc(doc_folder)
```

with doc_folder being a path to a certain folder containing .doc-files.

### Example

```         
# Convert the .doc-files from a example folder with .doc-files from the toy folder
convert_doc(doc_folder = "toy/toy_doc")
```

## *create_df_2*

### Decription

-   This function creates a Dataset from all .txt-files located in the specified folder, containing the columns "langer_beleg", "pruef_beleg" and "pruef_stelle". The files used in the example were automatically loaded with the package and should be located in your project folder as a folder named "toy", after you installed the package and executed convert_doc on the doc_folder.

-   The lines of the .txt files are split according to sentences (ending with . ! or ?), and lines split by entries are merged (words split by hyphenation are rejoined).

-   Entries in () and sentences consisting of only one word (one or more letters) are excluded from this process - the latter is intended, among other things, to handle abbreviations.

-   Consecutive word strings in all caps are given their own line. Beforehand, some cleanup operations are performed that could interfere with the line splitting process.

-   Edition references in () are removed from the text file names (e.g., (ed. N. Bubnov, Gerberti opera math. 1899. p. 203,7)).

-   In the event that a sentence ends with an abbreviation and thus part of the sentence would be cut off, the next sentence is appended to sentences that are at most 5 words long.

-   Since there is between the supporting texts and quotations contain an irregular use of the letters u and v, all v's are replaced by u.

-   All non-letters are removed from the reference, and only the first 3 words of the reference are retained.

-   Afterwards the function creates two new columns from the text column (long_document and test_document), where the test_document column reduces words longer than 3 letters and spaces, and converts all uppercase letters to lowercase

### Output

-   An evidence dataset containing the columns "langer_beleg", "pruef_beleg" and "pruef_stelle" and that is ready for use with merge_df

### Assumptions

-   The folder containing the .txt-files contains only .txt-files (and no other documents or folders).

-   The editorial notes in parentheses in the .txt file names have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado.

-   Sentences ending with an abbreviation are no more than 5 words long.

-   The following expressions in the source material have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado:

    -   Arabic numerals (with a p.:\* or l.:*)* before them or in parentheses () or \<\> or [] or with [a-z] after them or a period

    -   Roman or Arabic numerals at the beginning of a line (with a period after them)\*

    -   The expression "\\t"

    -   The characters ….../\|\*«»„“+¯\_\<\>”’[]

    -   Any expressions in parentheses

-   Lines of the following type in the source material (noted as pseudo-regular expressions) have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado:

    -   Roman or Arabic numerals (with a period after them)\*, which occupy an entire line

    -   "Achtung Sonderzeichen\|Sonderzeichen\|Sonderzeichen unterstrichen!\*", which occupy an entire line

    -   "Korrektur" as the beginning of a line

    -   "Rasur von [arabische Zahl] Zeile(n)" that occupy an entire line

    -   "Druckfehler verbessert" that occupy an entire line

    -   "Latitudo [Arabic or Roman numeral]" that occupy an entire line

    -   "Longitudo [Arabic or Roman numeral]"

    -   "Überstreichungen Korrekturen" that occupy an entire line

    -   "ACHTUNG: GRIECHISCH" that occupy an entire line

    -   "Achtung:" as beginning of line

    -   "Druckfehler verbessert:" as beginning of line

### Usage

```         
create_df_2(txt_folder)
```

with txt_folder being a path to a certain folder containing the .txt-files.

### Example

```         
# Create the evidence dataFrame
toy_belege <- create_df_2(txt_folder = "toy/toy_doc_txt")
# View the result
View(toy_belege)
```

## *create_df*

### Description

-   This function creates a DataFrame from all .mlw-files located in the specified folder, containing the columns "lemma", "u\*\_bedeutung", "zitat" and "stelle".

-   The files used in the example were automatically loaded with the package and should be located in your project folder as a folder named "toy", after you installed the package.

-   The functtion leans up the lemma information, adds the field name ZITAT, renames the field name UNTER_BEDEUTUNG to BEDEUTUNG and

-   Entries that do not have a field name such as BEDEUTUNG or LEMMA are recursively appended to the last entry with a field name

-   Replaces the field name ANHÄNGER with the field name of the last member of the U\*\_BEDEUTUNG-layers

-   The function removes all elements in the quote column that do not belong to the actual quoted text.

-   The function is not limited to a specific number of layers of meaning but dynamically adds as many layers of meaning as necessary.

-   Reduces the lemma entry to its first word.

-   Removes all entries in (((()))), (()), (), {{}}, {}, \<\<\>\>, \<\>, '' in the quote column.

-   Removes all \\\|#/\\.\^\*:‘; in the quote column. - All non-letters are removed from the reference, leaving only the first 3 words.

-   The citation column is reduced to words longer than 3 letters and spaces, and all capital letters are converted to lowercase.

-   Because there is an irregular use of the letters u and v between the source texts and the quotations, all v's are replaced with u.

-   Splits lines containing multiple quotations into individual quotations.

-   Adds missing references that were not recorded when entering multiple quotations in one column.

-   Removes line and page numbers from the references.

-   All non-letters are removed from the reference, leaving only the first 3 words.

### Output

-   An article dataset containing the columns "lemma", "u\*\_bedeutung", "zitat" and "stelle" and that is ready for use with merge_df

### Assumptions

-   The folder containing the mlw files contains only mlw files (and no other documents or folders).

-   Any Arabic numerals, annotations in parentheses () or curly braces {} in the lemma entry have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado.

-   All citations in the mlw files begin with an asterisk (\*).

-   Entries with the following field names can be removed without further ado:

    -   AUTOR(IN)

    -   STRUKTUR

    -   ETYMOLOGIE

    -   GRAMMATIK

    -   VEL

    -   METRIK

    -   SCHREIBWEISE

    -   UNTERDRÜCKE

    -   GEBRAUCH

    -   Absatz

    -   ANHÄNGER

<!-- -->

-   The first word of the lemma entry is sufficient, and the rest can be deleted without further ado.

-   All entries in (((()))), (()), (), {{}}, {}, \<\<\>\>, \<\>, '' in the quote column have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado.

-   All \\\|#/\\.\^\*:‘; in the quote column have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado.

-   All quotations are enclosed in quotation marks.

-   Everything in columns containing quotations, between the quotation marks, belongs to the source reference.

### Usage

```         
create_df(mlw_folder)
```

with a path to a certain folder containing the .mlw-files.

### Example

```         
# Create the article dataFrame
toy_artikel <- create_df(mlw_folder = "toy/toy_mlw")
# View the result
View(toy_artikel)
```
