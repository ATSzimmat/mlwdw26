# mlwdw26 (MLW Data Wrangling 2026)

Welcome to the R package mlwdw26 – a new tool for organizing the data generated in the creation of the Medieval Latin Dictionary (MLW), which is being developed at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAdW) since 1939!

## Motivation

## Functions

### convert_doc

#### Description

This function converts .doc-files to .txt files using the LibreOffice program. The files used in the example are automatically loaded with the package and should be located in your project folder as a folder named "toy", after you installed the package. This function takes into account the outdated line-break logic of doc-files. Note: This function requires LibreOffice to be located in a folder named "Applications" and that you are currently using a Mac.

#### Output

A new folder was created containing the converted files. The name of this folder is the same as the folder containing the .doc-files, with "\_txt" appended to the end.

#### Assumptions

The folder containing the .doc files contains only .doc files (and no other documents or folders).

The user's computer (importantly a Mac) has the same LibreOffice program installed as the creator's computer, and it is located in the "Applications" folder.

#### Usage

```         
convert_doc(doc_folder)
```

with doc_folder being a path to a certain folder containing .doc-files.

#### Example

```         
# Convert the .doc-files from a example folder with .doc-files from the toy folder
convert_doc(doc_folder = "toy/toy_doc")
```

### create_df_2

#### Decription

This function creates a DataFrame from all .txt-files located in the specified folder, containing the columns "langer_beleg", "pruef_beleg" and "pruef_stelle". The files used in the example were automatically loaded with the package and should be located in your project folder as a folder named "toy", after you installed the package and executed convert_doc on the doc_folder.

#### Output

An evidence dataset containing the columns "langer_beleg", "pruef_beleg" and "pruef_stelle" and that is ready for use with merge_df

#### Assumptions

The following expressions in the source material have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado:

-   Arabic numerals (with a p.:\* or l.:*)* before them or in parentheses () or \<\> or [] or with [a-z] after them or a period

-   Roman or Arabic numerals at the beginning of a line (with a period after them)\*

-   The expression "\\t"

-   The characters ….../\|\*«»„“+¯\_\<\>”’[]

-   Any expressions in parentheses

Lines of the following type in the source material (noted as pseudo-regular expressions) have no special meaning and can be deleted without further ado:

-   Roman or Arabic numerals (with a period after them)\*, which occupy an entire line

-   "Achtung Sonderzeichen\|Sonderzeichen\|Sonderzeichen unterstrichen!\*", which occupy an entire line

-   "Korrektur" as the beginning of a line

-   "Rasur von [arabische Zahl] Zeile(n)" that occupy an entire line

-   "Druckfehler verbessert" that occupy an entire line

-   "Latitudo [Arabic or Roman numeral]" that occupy an entire line

-   "Longitudo [Arabic or Roman numeral]"

-   "Überstreichungen Korrekturen" that occupy an entire line

-   "ACHTUNG: GRIECHISCH" that occupy an entire line

-   "Achtung:" as beginning of line

-   "Druckfehler verbessert:" as beginning of line

#### Usage

```         
create_df_2(txt_folder)
```

with txt_folder being a path to a certain folder containing the .txt-files.

#### Example

```         
# Create the evidence dataFrame
toy_belege <- create_df_2(txt_folder = "toy/toy_doc_txt")
# View the result
View(toy_belege)
```

## Installation
